    <p class="aboutP">
      Password Amplifier was designed to provide users a way have unlimited
      amount of passwords with out ever needing to remember any of them. Here is
      how it works.
    </p>
    <ul class="aboutUL">
      <li class="aboutLI">
        Chose a unique keyword or phrase, "i love pizza" for example. Please
        note spaces will not be accounted for, the algorithm is designed to
        remove all spaces.
      </li>
      <li class="aboutLI">
        Enter the domain you want to access gmail.com for example. If you enter
        "https://mail.google.com" or gmail.com the end result will be based on
        "gmail" all extra characters will be removed, hence you will receive the
        same output if you only use "gmail".
      </li>
      <li>
        With only a single letter for your keyword and a domain name that has
        only two characters, you will be provided with a 14 character password.
      </li>
    </ul>
