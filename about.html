    <h1 class="aboutH1">Why choose Password Amplifier?</h1>

    <p class="aboutP">
      Password Amplifier was designed to provide users a way have unlimited
      amount of passwords with out ever needing to remember any of them. Here is
      how it works.
    </p>
    <ul class="aboutUL">
      <li class="aboutLI">
        The user choses a unique keyword or phrase, "i love pizza" for example.
        Please note spaces will not be accounted for, the algorithm is designed
        to remove all white spaces. All that matters is that you have the same
        sequence of letters.
      </li>
      <li class="aboutLI">
        The user then enters the domain they want to access gmail.com for
        example. The way the user enters enters the domain name has no effect on
        the end result because only "gmail" will be used by the algorithm, its
        designed to strip down all extra characters. It doess not matter if the
        user enters www.gmail.com, gmail.com the end result will be based on
        "gmail".
      </li>
      <li class="aboutLI">
        Password Amplifier then generates a unique password based on information
        that you provided and returns a complex set of keys.
      </li>
      <li class="aboutLI">
        if the user needs to those same exact keys again, they simply have to
        provide there keyword or secret phrase followed by the website they are
        visiting.
      </li>
      <li>
        With only a single letter for your keyword and a domain name that has
        only two characters, you will be provided with a 14 character password.
      </li>
    </ul>
